Based on STLport-4.6.2

Status and bugs:

-) thread locking missing.
-) fstream buffering probably messed up.
-) lots of holes to fill in ps2dev's libc (time functions, ctype, mb* functions)
   so that it maybe won't link correctly if you're using STL stuff about that.


Don't forget that, to use it, you need to -I $(PS2SDK)/ports/include/stlport
