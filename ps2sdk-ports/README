                     PS2SDK-PORTS PACKAGE
		     --------------------

What is it ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  This CVS directory is mostly a placeholder for a various number of ports
working	with the current ps2sdk. It is not intended to be a releasable package.
The idea is to have something similar to bsd's ports scheme. Maybe later on,
if the tree grows up, we will sort projects into subdirectories.


How to use it ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  First, you have to know you can checkout one single directory out of the tree,
without having to checkout all of them. For example, you can simply do:

      cvs co ps2sdk-ports/sdl

  in order to pull the SDL port out of the CVS. And if you want to grab the
single ps2sdk-ports directory without grabbing any other subdirectory, just do:

      cvs co -l ps2sdk-ports

  Afterward, each port should have a single, working, ps2sdk-enabled makefile.
Which means that if you have the whole ps2dev's toolchain, and the ps2sdk, a
simple 'make' should build the corresponding port, unless stated otherwise in
the port.



    Have fun!
