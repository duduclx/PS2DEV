INTRODUCTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ps2gdbStub is a tcp stub for the gnu debugger. It could be easily changed
 to not use tcp. The low level portion reads 128 bits for the 32 gprs and
 also for lo and hi, although these are converted down to 32 bits before
 sending to the remote GDB.

 Currently, the code *must* be uploaded via pukklink or ps2link. Naplink
 won't do it!

 As for building the remote GDB, I configured gdb as mips-idt-elf and hacked
 about with it a bit. I managed to get the latest weekly snapshot (which at
 time of writing was gdb+dejagnu-20030801.tar.bz2) to work, after some hacking
 around. I've included a .cmd file for use with the remote GDB. You'll need
 to change the target line with the correct IP of your ps2. To invoke, from
 the shell, type <gdb -x ps2.cmd>

 With reference to the frame pointer, gpr $30 should be the frame pointer,
 this is what the MIPS abi says anyway. However, our toolchain appears to use
 grp $30 as another saved register (s8), so I just report the fp to be the
 same as the sp at the moment.
